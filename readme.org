* Tracter

Tracter aspires to be the only tool you need to get all the information for a website.

** Initial basic usage

- =tracter who -url example.com=

    Provides the basic whois data

- =tracter ssl -url example.com= (TODO)

    Provides the ssl certs data, such as expiration etc

- =tracter find -url example.com= (TODO)

    Works like a domain search, may provide alternate solutions
